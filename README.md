# About
This is the web application that is accompanying my application for the VID MilTech internship position. Feel free to organize the list of users by clicking the deltas in the header of each respective column. You can also hover over each user and see a mock profile card.

# Building Docker Image
Feel free to run the project as a container in Docker. For the sake of continuity, here are the commands I used to build and run the image:
"docker build -t vid-internship ."
"docker run -dp 80:80 vid-internship"
